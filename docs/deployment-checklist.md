## üîÑ Rollback Procedures

### When to Rollback
- Critical functionality broken
- Security vulnerability discovered
- Performance severely degraded
- Data corruption detected

### Rollback Steps

#### 1. Frontend Rollback
```bash
# Rollback to previous image
kubectl rollout undo deployment/iyield-frontend -n iyield
kubectl rollout status deployment/iyield-frontend -n iyield
```

#### 2. Oracle Rollback
```bash
# Revert configuration
kubectl patch configmap iyield-config -n iyield \
  --patch='{"data":{"csv-vault-address":"'$PREVIOUS_VAULT_ADDRESS'"}}'
kubectl rollout restart deployment/iyield-oracle -n iyield
```

#### 3. Database Rollback (if needed)
```bash
# Restore from snapshot (DESTRUCTIVE)
aws rds restore-db-instance-from-db-snapshot \
  --db-instance-identifier iyield-oracle-db-restore \
  --db-snapshot-identifier $PRE_DEPLOY_SNAPSHOT
```

#### 4. Contract Rollback
**Note**: Smart contracts cannot be directly rolled back. Options:
- Pause new contracts via guardian
- Route traffic to previous contract versions
- Emergency governance vote for emergency fixes

### Post-Rollback
- [ ] **Validation**: All systems working with previous version
- [ ] **Monitoring**: Metrics back to baseline
- [ ] **Communication**: Users notified of rollback
